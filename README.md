# COVID-19_Analyse
Datasets and analysis of data related to Coronavirus

This repository consists all the files related to my voluntary work towards data wrangling and visualization.

First of all, COVID-19 dataset available on Kaggle is used to analyse the data and generate few visualizations. A Tableau dashboard is also created using the same dataset.

Even though numerous resources available to get the required dataset, it is good to have a self-created dataset. Hence, using basic python libraries pandas, numpy and BeautifulSoup I scraped the data from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus into my own data set.
A article regarding Web Scraping is also published on Medium.com which refers back to this work. The article can be read here - https://towardsdatascience.com/web-scraping-make-your-own-dataset-cc973a9f0ee5
